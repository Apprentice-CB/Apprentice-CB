This repository is for introducing myself.

My name is Yewon Lee.
I live in Seoul, South Korea.

I got bachelor's degree at Department of Electronic Engineering at Sogang University, South Korea.
And I got master's degree at Signal Processing Systems. Lab (Advisor: Tai-kyong Song) at Sogang University (Department of EE), (Graduated at 2023.02).
My research field at master's course is ultrasound signal processing and system design.

My interests are H/W design (including HDL coding and PCB and circuit schematic design), embedded systems (especially MCUs like Cortex M3), and parallel processings (CUDA, openCL, etc...).

I once interned at SoC design team of Samsung Electronics' S.LSI division (2019.09 ~ 2019.12). 
During my internship, I worked on automaing clock tree generation using python and regular expressions.

Now I'm currently working on S/W Developement Team in CTO division, LG Innotek (from 2023.02 ~ ).
My current field is real-time implementation of deep learning networks in embedded systems.
